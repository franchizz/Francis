# Francis' profile
## So here's a brief profile of Francis:
I'm a third semester undergraduate student at Universitas Gadjah Mada, currently studying Geophysiscs in the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. 
I'm aiming to become a great Geophysicist especially in the field of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS). 
I'm still learning to do a little bit of coding and programming here and there and I'm really trying my best in this journey :smile:

## And this is me trying to do the fun stuff

## Closing Statement
At the end of the day, we're all humans just trying to live and do our best. We're not perfect, we're not omniscient, and we're not omnipotent. We're just trying to do our best and learn from the experiences we have.

I'm Francis, and I'm still **<mark>learning</mark>**.
